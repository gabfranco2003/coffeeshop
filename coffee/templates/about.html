            <p>
                Founded in 2023, Java Junction started as a small coffee cart in the heart of the city. What began as a passion project quickly grew into a beloved local cafe. Today, we are proud to serve a wide range of beverages, from classic coffees to specialty teas, as well as fresh pastries made daily.
